Fun Description:
----------------

- KiteMania

We live in Catalonia and we love kitesurfing, therefore we decided to make a full-stack application which helps ourselves! 

This project focuses on delivering information to its users by analyzing a database of kitesurfing spots. The information will be processed from a database, then presented on a website. 

The database will contain information about each spot: surroundings, temperature, wind and waves/water information is available in each java class.

On the website, a list of all kitesurf spots on the coast of Catalonia can be found. One can also filter and sort to extract the best spot for specific conditions. Furthermore, user experiences at certain spots can be uploaded back to our database to form a rating for each spot.

Technical Description:
